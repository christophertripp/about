## The amazing website of Christopher R. Tripp

My name is Chris.  My pronouns are he/him.

I recently received a B.A. in Mathematics and Physics from Marlboro College in Vermont.  I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Statistics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

My interests include Bayesian inference, machine learning, physical cosmology, and the neurophysics of consciousness.  I also have strong interests in the philosophy of science, especially the ethical and epistemological implications of artificial intelligence.

I am also eager to help increase BIPOC and LGBTQ+ representation and inclusion in STEM.  Please get in touch if you are able to share advice or experiences relating to this.
